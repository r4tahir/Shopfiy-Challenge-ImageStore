Used Bootstrap for some UI features as well. (npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap)

# You have $5 in your account to buy photos priced at $5 each, after you run out of funds you can still use the platform in viewing mode. 

Your bought photos are tracked and recorded to you numerically on the platform
