# How to Use

This Project uses the Unsplash API to generate photos on the search of a word/sentence.

Used Bootstrap for some UI features as well. 

# You have $5 in your account to buy photos priced at $5 each, after you run out of funds you can still use the platform in viewing mode. 

Your bought photos are tracked and recorded to you numerically on the platform
